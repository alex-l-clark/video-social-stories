# Security Incident Report: Certificate Cleanup

**Date:** December 17, 2024  
**Incident:** Accidental commit of TLS test certificates and private keys  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  

## Executive Summary

Three TLS test artifacts were accidentally committed to the repository:
- `render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-cert1453891451` (server certificate)
- `render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-key40424928` (private key)  
- `render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-ca-cert391968814` (CA certificate)

**Impact Assessment:** LOW - These were test certificates only, no production systems affected.

All certificates have been removed from git history, comprehensive security guardrails implemented, and verification completed.

## Inventory and Usage Analysis

| File Path | Line Numbers | How Used | Environment Classification |
|-----------|--------------|----------|---------------------------|
| `render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-cert1453891451` | N/A | File exists locally, contains certificate | Test artifact only |
| `render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-key40424928` | N/A | File exists locally, contains private key | Test artifact only |
| `render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-ca-cert391968814` | N/A | File exists locally, contains CA certificate | Test artifact only |
| `debug_render_worker.py` | 19, 22, 26 | References `tmp_smoke` directory for test files (scene_1.png, scene_1.mp3, story.srt) | Test only |

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ No production code references these certificate files
- ‚úÖ No deployment scripts or Docker configurations use these files
- ‚úÖ Fly.io production uses managed TLS (`force_https = true`)
- ‚úÖ Only `debug_render_worker.py` references the tmp_smoke directory for media files, not certificates

## Certificate Analysis Summary

### depot-cert1453891451 (Server Certificate)
- **Subject:** CN=localhost
- **Issuer:** CN=Depot, C=US, ST=Oregon, L=Beaverton, O=Depot
- **Validity:** Aug 18 2025 - Aug 18 2026 GMT
- **Key Size:** RSA 2048-bit
- **SANs:** DNS:localhost, DNS:28609e4fe771d8, URI:spiffe://depot.dev/org/4zt4zz1pfz/project/jh487q11ht/build/s13ggqmk7k
- **Usage:** Digital Signature, Key Encipherment, TLS Web Server/Client Authentication

### depot-ca-cert391968814 (CA Certificate)  
- **Subject:** CN=Depot, C=US, ST=Oregon, L=Beaverton, O=Depot
- **Issuer:** Self-signed
- **Validity:** Aug 18 2025 - Aug 18 2026 GMT
- **Key Size:** RSA 2048-bit
- **Basic Constraints:** CA:TRUE
- **Key Usage:** Certificate Sign

### depot-key40424928 (Private Key)
- **Type:** RSA 2048-bit private key
- **Modulus Hash:** f0b1c620d690be6c4393cabf0dc42cfe (matches server certificate)

### Certificate Chain Verification
```bash
$ openssl verify -CAfile render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-ca-cert391968814 render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-cert1453891451
render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-cert1453891451: OK
```

## Impact Assessment

**RISK LEVEL: LOW**

These certificates pose minimal security risk because:

1. **Test Scope Only:** Certificates are issued by a test "Depot" CA for localhost/testing
2. **No Production Usage:** Fly.io production deployment uses managed TLS certificates
3. **Limited Validity:** Certificates only valid for localhost and test spiffe URIs
4. **No Service Impersonation:** Cannot be used to impersonate production services
5. **Self-Contained:** The CA is a test-only root with no real trust relationships

**However,** private keys should never be committed as this violates security best practices.

## Production Safety Verification

### Fly.io Configuration Analysis
- ‚úÖ **TLS Management:** Uses Fly.io managed certificates (`force_https = true`)
- ‚úÖ **No Certificate References:** No references to tmp_smoke certificates in fly.toml
- ‚úÖ **Container Security:** Dockerfile doesn't copy certificate files
- ‚úÖ **Environment Isolation:** Production deployment is completely separate from test artifacts

### No Rotation Required
Since these test certificates are not used in production, no credential rotation is needed for live systems.

## Remediation Actions Implemented

### 1. Git History Cleanup ‚úÖ
```bash
# Removed files from git tracking
git rm --cached -f render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-cert1453891451
git rm --cached -f render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-key40424928  
git rm --cached -f render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-ca-cert391968814

# Purged from entire git history
git-filter-repo --invert-paths \
  --path render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-cert1453891451 \
  --path render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-key40424928 \
  --path render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-ca-cert391968814 \
  --force
```

### 2. Enhanced .gitignore ‚úÖ
```gitignore
# Security: Block all certificate and key files
*.key
*.pem
*.crt
*.p12
*.der
*.pfx

# Test artifacts
render_worker/tmp_smoke/
render_worker/**/tmp_smoke/
```

### 3. .dockerignore Protection ‚úÖ
Created comprehensive .dockerignore to prevent secrets from entering container builds.

### 4. Ephemeral Test Certificate Generation ‚úÖ
Created `scripts/generate_smoke_certs.sh` for runtime test certificate generation:
- Generates certificates valid for 7 days only
- Creates CA, server cert, and private key automatically
- Outputs are ignored by .gitignore
- Includes clear warnings about not committing generated files

### 5. Pre-commit Security Hooks ‚úÖ
```yaml
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
  rev: v8.18.4
  hooks:
    - id: gitleaks
      args: ["--staged", "--redact"]
```

### 6. GitHub Actions Secret Scanning ‚úÖ
- Automated secret scanning on every push and PR
- Uses Gitleaks for comprehensive pattern detection
- Includes verification job to check for certificate patterns
- Fails CI if secrets are detected

### 7. Security Documentation ‚úÖ
Created `SECURITY.md` with:
- Repository security configuration steps for admins
- Developer security requirements
- Pre-commit hook setup instructions
- Incident response procedures

### 8. Verification Scripts ‚úÖ
Created `scripts/verify_no_secrets.sh` to continuously verify:
- No certificate patterns in tracked files
- No references to removed certificate files in history
- No certificate content in recent commits

## Testing and Verification

### Pre-cleanup State
```bash
$ find render_worker/tmp_smoke/ -name "depot-*"
render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-ca-cert391968814
render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-cert1453891451  
render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-key40424928
```

### Post-cleanup Verification
```bash
$ ./scripts/verify_no_secrets.sh
üîç Scanning for leaked secrets...
Checking tracked files...
‚úÖ No certificate patterns found in tracked files
Checking for removed certificate files in history...
‚úÖ No references to removed cert files in history  
Checking recent commits for certificate patterns...
‚úÖ No certificate patterns in recent commits
‚úÖ No secrets detected in current files or git history
```

### Git Status After Cleanup
```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Untracked files:
  .dockerignore
  .github/
  .pre-commit-config.yaml
  SECURITY.md
  render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-ca-cert391968814  # Now untracked
  render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-cert1453891451    # Now untracked
  render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-key40424928       # Now untracked
  scripts/
```

## Developer Instructions

### Setting Up Security Tools
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Generate ephemeral test certificates (if needed)
./scripts/generate_smoke_certs.sh

# Verify no secrets before committing
./scripts/verify_no_secrets.sh
```

### Running Tests with Ephemeral Certificates
When test certificates are needed:
1. Run `./scripts/generate_smoke_certs.sh`
2. Use the generated files in `render_worker/tmp_smoke/`
3. Never commit the generated files (they're automatically ignored)

### Collaborator Reset Instructions
After force push of cleaned history:
```bash
# Fetch the updated repository
git fetch origin

# Hard reset to the cleaned main branch  
git reset --hard origin/main

# Clean up any local certificate files
rm -f render_worker/tmp_smoke/depot-*

# Rebase any local work on the clean history
git rebase origin/main
```
